These scripts can be run on Linux systems, and is used for my daily health checks.

Please note - this is my script and NOT supported or approved or affiliated to/by any company mentioned above.

Script runs daily - copy output to mail server - send script to e-mail address.

Example...

/usr/netvault/util/nvsendmail -d "receiver@example.com" -r "sender@example.com" -s "Title" -f "/tmp/health.report.log"
